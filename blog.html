            <p class="answer"><b>Local storage : </b> Local storage is available in the browser to all windows with the
                same domain. Data stored
                in the local storage is also available after the window has been closed. The next time a window is
                opened and loads the page from the same origin, the page can access the stored values there again.</p>

            <p class="answer"><b>Session storage : </b>Session storage is available inside the same browser window for
                as
                long as the window is open. When the browser window is closed, the session storage associated with that
                window is deleted. Multiple windows from the same origin (URL) cannot see each others session storage.

            <h3 class="blog-qus">Difference between Global scope and Block scope</h3>
            <p class="answer"><b>Global scope : </b> Any variable declared in global scope can be accessed anywhere.It
                means that any code on our page has access to read and modify this variable. The way we make something
                apply globally is by declaring it in our code completely outside of a function.</p>

            <p class="answer"><b>Block scope : </b>A block scoped variable means that the variable defined within a
                block will not be accessible from outside the block. A block can reside inside a function, and a block
                scoped variable will not be available outside the block even if the block is inside a function.

            <h3 class="blog-qus">Working Process of Event Loop</h3>
            <p class="answer"><b>Event Loop : </b>The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear
                before pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop
                triggers and checks the Task Queue for available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes it to the Call
                Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same process.

            <h3 class="blog-qus">When we get "Undefined"</h3>
            <p class="answer">An undefined variable or anything without a value will always return "undefined" in
                JavaScript.
                <br>
                When a variable is declared or initialized but no value is assigned to it, JavaScript automatically
                displays "undefined".
                <br>
                Also, when we try accessing values in, for example, an array or object that doesn`t exist, it will throw
                undefined.
